# Performance Profiling Analysis - October 2025

## Executive Summary

Based on comprehensive profiling of the network simplex solver across 6 problem sizes, we have identified the **precise bottlenecks** and can now prioritize optimization efforts with data-driven confidence.

**Key Finding:** On large problems (4,267 arcs, 65.9s runtime), **91% of total runtime** is spent in just **4 functions**, with Forrest-Tomlin solve alone consuming **50%** of total time.

## Profiling Results Overview

| Problem | Nodes | Arcs | Time (s) | Iters | Time/Iter |
|---------|-------|------|----------|-------|-----------|
| Small Transport (5×5) | 10 | 25 | 0.075 | 19 | 3.9ms |
| Medium Transport (15×15) | 30 | 225 | 0.989 | 134 | 7.4ms |
| Large Transport (30×30) | 60 | 900 | 6.981 | 494 | 14.1ms |
| Small Network (10) | 40 | 267 | 1.024 | 84 | 12.2ms |
| Medium Network (20) | 80 | 1066 | 7.297 | 228 | 32.0ms |
| **Large Network (40)** | **160** | **4267** | **65.864** | **356** | **185.0ms** |

**Scalability Analysis:**
- Time per iteration grows **47x** from small to large problems (3.9ms → 185ms)
- This super-linear growth indicates algorithmic bottlenecks, not just problem size

## Numba JIT Compilation Impact Assessment

Based on profiling, Numba will provide **limited gains** because:

1. **Top bottlenecks are already in C** (SuperLU, Forrest-Tomlin's core)
2. **Pricing is Python-heavy** (4.4s) - Numba could help here (2-3x speedup = 3s saved)
3. **Weight updates** (3.9s) - Numba could help (2x speedup = 2s saved)

**Estimated Numba Impact:** 5s saved (7% overall)
**Priority:** Medium (after vectorization)
