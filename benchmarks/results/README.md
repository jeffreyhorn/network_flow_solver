# Benchmark Results

This directory contains output files from benchmark runs demonstrating the performance improvements from optimization projects.

## Project 1: Cache Basis Solves

### projection_analysis_results.txt
**Week 1 Analysis - Cache Hit Rate Potential**

Results from analyzing projection patterns to design the cache strategy.

**Key Findings:**
- Small problems: Limited cache benefit (low repetition)
- Medium problems: 60-70% cache hit potential
- Large problems: 80-90% cache hit potential
- Conclusion: Cache size of 100-200 projections optimal

**Generated by:** `scripts/analyze_projection_patterns.py`  
**Date:** October 23, 2024  
**Purpose:** Informed cache design decisions for Project 1

### cache_benchmark_results.txt
**Cache Size Performance Tuning**

Benchmark results comparing different cache sizes to find optimal configuration.

**Test Configurations:**
- Cache disabled (baseline)
- Cache size 50
- Cache size 100
- Cache size 200

**Results:**
- Small problems (35 nodes): 3-5% speedup
- Medium problems (70 nodes): 10-14% speedup (optimal)
- Large problems (130 nodes): 5-10% speedup
- Optimal cache size: 100 (balance of performance and memory)

**Generated by:** `scripts/benchmark_projection_cache.py`  
**Date:** October 23, 2024  
**Purpose:** Tuned `projection_cache_size` default value

## Using These Results

These files document the empirical data that informed optimization decisions:

- **Cache size selection:** 100 chosen based on cache_benchmark_results.txt
- **Cache strategy:** Dict-based cache chosen based on projection_analysis_results.txt
- **Final implementation:** See `docs/project_plans/CACHE_OPTIMIZATION_RESULTS.md`

## Reproducing Results

To regenerate these benchmarks:

```bash
# Week 1 analysis (projection patterns)
python scripts/analyze_projection_patterns.py > benchmarks/results/projection_analysis_results.txt

# Cache size tuning
python scripts/benchmark_projection_cache.py > benchmarks/results/cache_benchmark_results.txt
```

**Note:** Results may vary slightly based on:
- Problem random seed
- Python version
- NumPy/SciPy versions
- Hardware (CPU, memory)
