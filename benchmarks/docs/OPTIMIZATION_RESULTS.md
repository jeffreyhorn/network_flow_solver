# Phase 1 Optimization Results

**Date**: 2025-10-25  
**Branch**: `performance/profiling-analysis`  
**Optimizations**: Rebuild frequency + Array sync

## Executive Summary

Implemented two Phase 1 optimizations that achieved **1.59x average speedup** on small benchmark problems, with one additional problem now solving.

**Key Results**:
- ✅ **Success rate improved**: 39% → 44% (7/18 → 8/18 problems)
- ✅ **All solutions validate correctly** (capacity and flow conservation)
- ✅ **Consistent speedup**: 1.3-2.2x across all problem types
- ✅ **Best case**: 3.79x speedup on test problem (gridgen_8_09a cold start)
- ⚠️ **Still 10/18 timeouts**: Need Phase 2 optimizations (iteration count reduction)

---

## Optimization #1: Reduce Basis Rebuild Frequency

**Problem**: Checking expensive condition number estimation on every pivot (98% rebuild rate).

**Solution**: Added `condition_check_interval` option (default: 10) to check every N pivots instead.

**Impact**: 
- Standalone: 1.48x speedup (12.3s → 8.3s on test case)
- Reduces condition number estimation overhead by 90%
- No impact on solution quality (same iterations, same objective)

---

## Optimization #2: Eliminate Full Array Synchronization

**Problem**: Copying all 4056 arcs from Python objects to NumPy arrays on every iteration.

**Solution**: 
- Update `arc_flows`, `arc_in_tree`, and residuals directly in `_pivot()`
- Replace `_sync_vectorized_arrays()` with lightweight `_sync_node_potentials()`
- Only sync what changes (10-50 arcs per pivot vs all 4056)

**Impact**:
- Combined with #1: 3.79x speedup (19.9s → 5.25s on test case cold start)
- Eliminates 99%+ of unnecessary array copies
- No impact on solution quality

## Analysis

### Why Test Case Showed 3.79x but Benchmarks Show 1.59x?

1. **Cold vs Warm Start**:
   - Profiling run (cold): 19.9s → 5.25s = 3.79x
   - Test run (warm): 12.3s → 5.25s = 2.34x
   - Benchmark run (warm): 26.1s → 15.6s = 1.67x

2. **Problem Structure Matters**:
   - GRIDGEN problems benefit most (1.67-1.91x)
   - GOTO problems benefit least (1.30-1.36x)
   - Different densities/structures respond differently to optimizations

3. **JIT Warmup Effects**:
   - First run includes Numba compilation overhead
   - Subsequent runs are faster due to cached JIT code
   - Benchmark runs are "warm" from previous problems

### goto_8_09a Iteration Count Issue

**Observation**: goto_8_09a now solves but requires 5513 iterations (vs 1204 for similar-sized gridgen_8_09a).

**Possible causes**:
1. GOTO problem structure is more difficult (denser, more degeneracy)
2. Different pivot path due to timing of basis rebuilds (non-determinism)
3. May need better pricing strategy for GOTO-specific structure

**Action needed**: Investigate in Phase 2 (pricing/degeneracy improvements).

## Remaining Issues

### 10 Problems Still Timing Out

**_09 variants** (512 nodes):
- netgen_8_09a: Still timeout (likely needs >10K iterations)

**_10, _11, _12 variants** (1024-4096 nodes):
- All timeout
- Need Phase 2: iteration count reduction

### Root Cause: Too Many Iterations

Even with 1.59x speedup per iteration, we still need:
- 650-1960 iterations for 256-node problems (should be 50-200)
- Estimated 5000-10000+ iterations for 512+ node problems

**Phase 2 Focus**: Reduce iteration count through:
1. Better pricing strategies (candidate lists, partial pricing)
2. Degeneracy handling improvements
3. Initial basis quality improvements

---

## Memory Usage

No change in memory consumption:
- Before: 1.7 GB average
- After: 1.5 GB average (slight improvement from less array churn)
- Still way too high for problem size

**Phase 2 target**: Reduce to <100 MB for 512-node problems.

---

## Validation

All 8 successful solves pass validation:
- ✅ Flow conservation: OK
- ✅ Capacity constraints: OK (parallel arcs handled correctly)
- ✅ Solution quality: Same objectives as before

---

## Next Steps (Phase 2)

### Priority 1: Reduce Iteration Count
- **Target**: 50-200 iterations for 256-node problems (currently 650-1960)
- **Approaches**:
  - Candidate list pricing (don't scan all arcs)
  - Partial pricing (scan subset of arcs)
  - Better anti-cycling strategies
  - Improve initial basis quality

### Priority 2: Memory Optimization
- **Target**: <100 MB for 512-node problems (currently 1.5 GB)
- **Approaches**:
  - Eliminate data structure duplication
  - Use more compact representations
  - Profile memory allocations

### Priority 3: Problem-Specific Optimizations
- **Investigate GOTO structure**: Why does goto_8_09a need 5513 iterations?
- **Optimize NETGEN problems**: Currently slowest per-iteration
- **Specialize pricing**: Detect problem structure and adapt strategy

---

## Conclusion

Phase 1 optimizations successfully achieved:
- ✅ **1.59x average speedup** (exceeded 2x on some problems)
- ✅ **One new problem solving** (44% vs 39% success rate)
- ✅ **All solutions still validate correctly**
- ✅ **Consistent improvement** across all problem types

However, **iteration count remains the primary bottleneck**. Phase 2 must focus on reducing iterations to achieve the next 2-3x speedup needed for medium problems.

**Current state**: Solver is now usable for small problems (256-512 nodes) but still 100-1000x slower than state-of-the-art.

**Phase 2 target**: Reduce iteration count by 5-10x to become competitive for medium problems (1K-4K nodes).

---

**Status**: Phase 1 complete, ready for Phase 2 (iteration count reduction)
